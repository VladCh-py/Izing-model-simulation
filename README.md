1D Izing model.py: This program allows you to simulate a 1-dimensional Ising model using the Monte Carlo method.
The main class "IsingModel" contains all the necessary parameters of the magnetized sample under study, the values of the external magnetic field and the number of simulation steps.
As a result, the program displays the hysteresis loop and the main magnetization curve. It is possible to change the number of points of the magnetized sample and the external magnetic
field.

2D Izing model.py: This program allows you to simulate a 2-dimensional Ising model using the Monte Carlo method.
The main class "IsingModel" contains all the necessary parameters of the magnetized sample under study, the values of the external magnetic field and the number of simulation steps.
During the program's operation, the dependence
of the sample's magnetization on the external magnetic field is displayed in real time. To the right of the dependence, a diagram of the states of the corresponding spins of the sample elements is displayed (white color- one direction of spin; black color- the other).
At the end, the resulting hysteresis loop and the main magnetization curve are displayed. The main magnetization curve is obtained by demagnetizing the sample and magnetizing it to saturation.
It is possible to change the number of points of the magnetized sample and the external magnetic
field.

Results.pdf: This file contains a brief description of the operation of the sample magnetization simulation program. The results of the program's operation under various parameters are presented.
